<title>Pipe Headloss Calculation</title>
<body>

<h1>Using the Darcy–Weisbach equation </h1>
<p>In fluid dynamics, the Darcy–Weisbach equation is an empirical equation, which relates the head loss, or pressure loss, due to friction along a given length of pipe to the average velocity of the fluid flow for an incompressible fluid</p>
